INTRODUCTION                                    *express*

express.vim defines an operator, `g=`, that allows you to change text
according to a VimL |expression|. Once invoked, an expression will be
prompted. In the expression, `v:val` will represent the text being operated
on (similar to |map()|).

MAPPINGS                                        *express-mappings*

                                                *g=*
g={motion}              Replace the text defined by {motion} with the value of
                        an expression. The expression is entered at the
                        command-line (with an '=' prompt). The original text
                        will populate the value of `v:val` within the
                        expression.
                                                *g==*
g=={motion}             Like |g=|, but for the current line. |linewise|

EXAMPLES                                        *express-examples*

Consider the following text:

    Hi, my name is "john jones"

With your cursor inside the quoted string, type `g=i"` and then input the
following expression on the prompt:

    substitute(v:val, '\<.', '\U\0', 'g')

The resulting text will be:

    Hi, my name is "John Jones"
